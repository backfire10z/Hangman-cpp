# Hangman-cpp

This is a hangman game with full input checking and both a single and multiplayer mode. 

FOR MULTIPLAYER: Simply run the code and follow the instructions to play.

FOR SINGLE PLAYER: The additional words.txt file must be added as a separate file that main.cpp will read from. Keep the file name the same (words.txt), as that is what my code extracts the words from.
